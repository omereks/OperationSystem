-------- CHAPTER 4 ---------
So, after Quavid-19 was very common, the minister of health in Duckland bought millions of vaccines.
The company that developed them named Athons (You have a better name? You are welcome to suggest one)
Anyhow, Duckland's population was very excited to get vaccinated.
They took the shots one by one, but here's the final twist of our weird story:
Athons was run by someone knows as Thanos. Weird name if you ask me, but probably most of the readers know the guy
And now, the twist: Every vaccine can either cure or kill whoever takes the doze.
Sounds familiar? I guess
So our geek duck got cured of the disease and decided to go back in time and prevent Thanos from succeeding.
And so our geek duck went back in time, met many super heroes on the way and somehow the world was saved.
