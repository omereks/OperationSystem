-------- CHAPTER 1 ---------
One day, the geek duck (which we will call in this chapter GD/gd/gD/Gd. Combinatorics yay)
Anyhow, one day, GD went to the pool
Gd now knows SOLID
Therefore, gd didn't get shocked (seriously, did you ever get shocked by batteries at the pool?)
But then, our not-so-lucky duck, went outside and got shocked by a thunder bolt.
Thunder bolt in the middle of April? Yeah, that's how unlucky gD is
It was supposed to be a great day, but GD ended up at the hospital.

To be continued...
