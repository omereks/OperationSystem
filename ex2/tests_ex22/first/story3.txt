-------- CHAPTER 3 ---------
First of all, did you see this file is in the wrong directory? or is it?
It is to make sure you iterate lexicographically.
Wow, such a big word lexicographically. Try say that 20 times fast
So back to our evolving story, our geek duck and Quavid-19.
It started infecting people, becoming the major Covid variant in Duckland (If algo can invent stupid city names, why can't I?)
And you know what comes next, implement an algorithm that determines how many contagious relationships there are in Duckland.
But here's the twist: Use geek duck favorite language.
Did you follow up all the previous non-sense I was writing?
If so, you know the answer is BASH!!
By the way, did you know the #!/bin/bash thing is called Shebang?
Shebang, such a big word for such a small line
So, lexicographically this file should be second. Is it really the case?
The answer and much more in chapter:

echo $[$(cat story3.txt | head -n 1 | tr -d '-' | tr -d ' ' | tr -d "\n" | tail -c 1) + 1]
