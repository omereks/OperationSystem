-------- CHAPTER 2 ---------
So, you like the little story we're trying to tell here? Good
So, remember where were we?
April
The middle of it
Cold
Thunders
Rain
And our poor geek duck is at the hospital
--Writer's note: You think I'm bored? You are the one reading my stories instead of studying for something more important
So, hospital. As you could already realize, our poor duck has no luck.
Guess what happened now? He got infected with Covid-19!
Because geek duck is a duck (it knows LSP right?) and got infected, it caused a variant to be created.
They called it Quavid-19 (Funny? No? I agree, but we're telling a story here)
More about what happened with Quavid-19 on the next chapter
